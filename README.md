# FartCAD
![FartCAD logo](img/logo.png)

Enhance your productivity with this brilliant macro! This macro releases a fart every time FreeCAD outputs an error (so yes, it farts a lot).

This project is still in its early stages, and a FartWorkbench is on the way, featuring a FartSketcher that will fart if you don't constrain your sketch correctly. Additionally, there's a FartPartDesign, which is very different from the FartPart, offering unique features to match its distinct name.

## Features:

- Asynchronous, Multi-threaded Fartâ„¢ engine.
- More than 30 different farts, with more on the way!
## Known Issue:

- False positive farts: There is no distinction between errors, warnings, or standard output messages.
- May cause a "fart fork bomb" in rare conditions.
